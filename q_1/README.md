# Question 1

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiple of 3 or 5, we get 3,4,6,9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

# Setup

Because the starting questions are simple, my goal is to create solutions in C++, Javascript, and Python _before_ I check whether or not the solution is valid. My secondary goals is for each of them to feature a different _way_ to solve the problem, at least where possible.

# Javascript

Just like the classic FizzBuzz problem, the solution to it is very simple. I would personally use this mostly as a way to make sure I like the setup of what I'm doing, the code compiles, etc. etc.

I use Node to run the main.js file, because its fast an easy.
